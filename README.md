Picking a good bottle of wine can be a daunting task for people who are not familiar with wine. When you are dining in a restaurant, the waiter can recommend a wine that blends with your meal. But what happens if you have to select a wine with endless choices of bottles with product descriptions on them? You might end up visiting multiple sites wondering which wine is good. However a wine specialist can quickly recognize a good wine by checking bottle label and product description with alcohol content or just tasting the wine.

The aim of this article is to predict the best quality wine and the important variables to check by examining a wine dataset and classifying wines using Random Forest Classification.
