# Wine_Quality_Predicion
Wine_Quality_Predicion using python, this repository contains all the python files and dependencies related to the project.

The Wine Quality dataset contains the physicochemical properties and quality ratings of red and white wine samples. In this tutorial, we will use red wine samples. Our goal is to train a random forest classifier to predict the quality of wine samples based on their physicochemical properties.

We will begin by preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then building and training a random forest classifier. We will evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set and then use it to make predictions on new data.
